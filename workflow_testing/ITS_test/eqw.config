## Settings descriptions:

## QIIME SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	16S_reference	(database reference fasta -- usually greengenes)
##	16S_taxonomy	(database taxonomy file -- usually greengenes)
##	16S_tree	(database tree file -- usually greengenes)
##	16S_chimeras	(fasta for filtering against -- usually gold.fa)
##	16S_alignment_template	(template file -- usually core_set_aligned.fasta.imputed)
##	16S_alignment_lanemask	(lanemask file -- usually lanemask_in_1s_and_0s)
##	ITS_reference	(database reference fasta -- usually UNITE)
##	ITS_taxonomy	(database taxonomy file -- usually UNITE)
##	ITS_chimeras	(not functional yet)
##	Split_libraries_qvalue	(Set to one less than desired level.  19 qill return q20 or better sequences.)
##	Threads_chimera_filter	(Threads to use during chimera filtering -- limit to # available processors.)
##	Threads_pick_otus	(Threads to use during OTU picking -- limit to # available processors.)
##	Threads_assign_taxonomy	(Threads to use during tax assignment -- limit to 8 or 12 depending on system.)
##	Threads_align_seqs	(Threads to use during sequence alignment (16S only) -- limit to # available processors.)
##	RDP_confidence	(Confidence bootstrap value required to make an assignment.  0.5-0.6 seems to work well.)
##	RDP_max_memory	(Will need a minimum of 6000.  Value is in MB.  Larger datasets or reference databases will require this value to be increased.  Decrease your thread count for tax assignment so you don't run out of RAM.)
##	ITS_RC_seqs	(True or False.  If your raw data is in opposite orientation from database, set to true to reverse complement after demultiplexing.)
##	16_RC_seqs	(True or False.  If your raw data is in opposite orientation from database, set to true to reverse complement after demultiplexing.)

## FASTQ-JOIN SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	Min_overlap	(Minimum overlap required during read joining steps.)
##	Max_mismatch	(Maximum mismatch allowed during read joining steps.)

## FASTQ-MCF SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	Threads_mcf	(Threads to use while filtering primer sequences from raw fastq data.)

## FASTQ_MULTX SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	Multx_errors	(Maximum indexing mismatches allowed during initial demultiplexing step.)

## SMALT SETTINGS BELOW HERE
##	PhiX_index	(ABSOLUTE path to your PhiX index generated with smalt.  Do NOT include file extensions.)
##	Threads_smalt	(Threads to use while filtering PhiX from raw fastq data.)

## ITSx SETTINGS BELOW HERE
## 	Threads_ITSx	(Threads to use during ITSx filtering -- limit to # available processors)
## 	ITSx_options	(Options to use for ITSx -- see ITSx manual for details)

## Settings in use for eqw.sh script below (without leading "#" characters).  Order is unimportant.
