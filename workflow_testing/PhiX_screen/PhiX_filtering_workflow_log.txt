Found 6000 total demultiplexed read pairs in your sequence data.
Your demultiplexed data contains sample data at this percentage: 98 (5923 out of 6000 total read pairs).
Your demultiplexed data contains PhiX contamination at this percentage: 2 (77 PhiX174-containing read pairs).

PhiX filtering step completed.

PhiX would have contributed 1 reads (out of 77 total PhiX reads among your demultiplexed data) to your dataset had you joined reads without filtering (an inflation of 0 percent).

You can cautiously estimate sample-to-sample contamination as a result of mixed clusters by dividing 77 into 6000.
Then subtract OTU counts on a PER SAMPLE basis at the resulting percentage (expressed as a decimal here): .0128333333

To do this, convert your raw biom table (do not even subtract singletons/doubetons yet) to text (see below for instructions specific to qiime 1.8) and manipulate it in a spreadsheet.  For every sample, sum the total sequencing counts.  Multiply this by .0128333333, and subtract this amount from every OTU bin.  Use an if function to set the new count to zero (in a separate worksheet) if the result is negative, and convert the result back to biom

Converting biom to txt:
biom convert -i otu_table.biom -o otu_table.txt --header-key taxonomy -b

Converting txt to biom:
biom convert -i filtered_otu_table.txt -o filtered_otu_table.biom --table-type="OTU table" --process-obs-metadata taxonomy
